# BMI_Calculator
A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool that estimates body fat based on height and weight, providing an indication of whether someone is underweight, healthy weight, overweight, or obese. 
**Purpose:**
It's a quick and easy way to assess if someone's weight is within a healthy range, but it's not a definitive measure of health. 
**Not a Diagnosis:**
BMI is a screening tool and should be used in conjunction with other health assessments and medical advice.
